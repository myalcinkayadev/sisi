## Main goal of the repository
 - Writing a tree-walking interpreter in go
- Learn by building and practice go.

### Features
- Integers, booleans, strings, arrays, hash maps
- A REPL
- Arithmetic expressions
- Let statements
- First-class and higher-order functions
- Built-in functions
- Recursion
- Closures

## Interpreter Roadmap
- Tokenize and parse source code in a REPL
- Building up an internal representation of the code called abstract syntax tree (AST) and then evaluate this tree

### Major Parts
- the lexer
- the parser
- the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- the internal object system
- the evaluator
